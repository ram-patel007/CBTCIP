            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Ram Patel, a B.Tech student in Computer Science at Prestige Institute of Engineering Management and Research. My key skills include HTML, CSS, and Java, and I also have a basic understanding of C and C++. I have developed projects such as an AI tutor and a scholarship assistance and guidance system.</p>
            <p>I've represented RGPV as a leader in the West Zone University Championship, winning the Best Player Award at the state level tournament in 2023. I've also led my handball team to victory three times at the nodal level.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton, table tennis, cricket, football, and especially handball, as well as listening to music, watching web series, and anime.</p>
